Hey, I'm Domojestic, but you can just call me Marcial.

I'm pretty new to Git and GitHub, but it seems like a pretty indispensable tool to just throw by the wayside if I have any actual interest in pursuing computer science and programming to any legitamate degree.

With that said, this is the profile I'll probably use for more "recreational" stuff; personal projects, little games (if I ever get the motivation), stuff to that effect. Might not be all that useful, but who knows. Maybe someone else will like it enough for the decision to be justified.

If I ever decide to go down a more "professional" route, or decide it might be best not to send, say, employers a repository from "@Domojestic," I'll make a new profile, and probably link it somewhere here.

Anyways, as far as development interests go, be they realistic or idealistic:
- Language learning software
- Video games (naturally)
  - 4X
  - Platorming
- Self-improvement tools (exercise tracking stuff, routine stuff, etc.)
<br/>

And as for programming languages:
- Decent-ish at Python
- Interested in learning C# (Unity), Java, C++, and HTML/CSS/javascript

As you can see, I'm *quite* the catch as far as skill and expertise goes.

Anyways, if you find this profile somehow and like what I'm doing (or see a way for me to do it better), let me know. But in all reality, you probably found this because you know me personally and I don't know why the hell there's a bug somewhere and need someone who actually knows what they're doing to help.

Alright, I think I've covered all my bases now. Adiós.
